# iw3sp-mod-rtx - nvidia RTX Remix compatibility mod

</div>

<div align="center" markdown="1"> 

This fork of the singleplayer client modification ([iw3sp_mod](https://gitea.com/JerryALT/iw3sp_mod)) for Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare (IW3)  
makes the game compatible with nvidia's [rtx-remix](https://github.com/NVIDIAGameWorks/rtx-remix). The client is originally based on the [IW4x Client](https://github.com/iw4x/iw4x-client)

#### Nightly (always up-to-date):

1) Install the latest full release (step above)

2) [rtx only] [optional] Install the latest full rtx-remix release (0.5.1 at this time)   
https://github.com/NVIDIAGameWorks/rtx-remix/tags

<br>

# Remix section

<div align="center" markdown="1">

游댱 To clarify, this client mod is only making CoD4 compatible with remix. 游댱  

My actual remix-mod with enhanced materials, meshes and lights can be found over at ModDB:   
[https://www.moddb.com/mods/cod4-mp-rtx-remix-iw3xo](https://www.moddb.com/mods/cod4-mp-rtx-remix-iw3xo)

(the `rtx-remix` directory contains small and simple sp-specific changes that are not part of the ModDB release)
(read the included README)

</div>

<br>

- A. Commandline Arguments:  

  - `-no_rtx` :: disable rtx modules
  - `-no_default_sky` :: disable sky spawning (map settings)
  - `-no_sun` :: disable sun spawning (map settings)
  - `-no_fog` :: disable fog (map settings)
  - `-stock_effects` :: render effects using shaders
  - `-no_forced_lod` :: do not set `r_forceLod` to `high` by default  
  - `-load_normal_spec` :: enable loading of specular and normal maps (if you need to for some reason)

> - commandline example: &ensp;`c:\path\iw3sp_mod.exe -no_forced_lod -no_fog` 

<br>

- B. Dvars:

	游릴 encouraged to be tweaked  
	游릱 can be useful in edge case scenarios  
	游릲 shouldn't be touched 

	#### Culling dvars:
	游릴 `rtx_culling_tweak_mins` :: prevents a bit of culling  
	游릴 `rtx_culling_tweak_maxs` :: prevents a lot of culling  
	游릴 `rtx_culling_tweak_frustum` :: disables frustum culling  
	游릴 `rtx_culling_tweak_smodel` :: disables static model culling  
	游릴 `rtx_culling_plane_dist` :: distance of frustum culling planes  

	#### General dvars:
	游릴 `r_forceLod` :: force all models to a specific LOD  
	游릴 `r_forceLod_second_lowest` :: prevent game from using the lowest LOD (sometimes used to hide the model)  
	游릴 `r_lodScaleRigid` :: adjust static model draw distances (lower values increase draw distance)  
	游릴 `r_showTess` :: draws material info (incl. all image names) of surfaces (geometry / models)  
	游릴 `r_showCellIndex` :: show portal index info (useful for manual culling overrides via map settings)  
	游릴 `r_showModelNames` :: draw names of static models around the player  

	#### Dvars that should only be changed if you know what you are doing: 
	游릲 `rtx_extend_smodel_drawing` :: disable static model draw limit (max amount of static models drawn at once)  

<br>

- C. Console Commands :
	- `mapsettings_update` :: reload map settings
	- `mapsettings_get_defaults` :: prints sun direction, color and intensity in map_settings format based on the stock map settings to the consle


#### map_settings.ini :: `root/iw3sp_data` 

游댲 Tweak sunlight / color, skybox and fog settings   
游댲 Override culling per portal / cell (to fix light or shadow culling - dvar `r_showCellIndex`)   
游댲 Spawn unique anchor meshes that can be used to attach unique prims and lights to  

<br>

## 丘멆잺 Current Issues
- Swift changes in geometry (eg. teleporting) can crash the game.
  - Decrease geometry drawing by increasing culling or play with `r_lodScaleRigid`

- Remix might try to use your onboard gpu (that is a general CoD issue), so its best to disable it in the bios or within the device manager 

- Some effects will slow down the game (really depends on the effect and the amount)
